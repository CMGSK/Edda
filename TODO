## TODO

    - [ ] For the love of god someone write a decent README (me, probably)

### Implementations
#### Core (master)

- [ ] Implement file management
- [ ] Study switching to `docx_rust` crate
- [ ] Try and find out how docx handles the wrapping and sizing in determined sheet sizes
- [ ] Test that the docx we're currently generating does actually have what we expect inside
- [ ] Check out how are we gonna handle metadata. I don't really like docx approach but...

#### GUI (feature/gui-implementation)

- [ ] Make the toolbar look right (spacing, separators, etc.)
- [ ] Study the most sensible way of implementing the callbacks to the buttons
- [ ] Fix the damn scrollbar
- [ ] Change window behaviour when writing below the botton part from resizing to generating a scrollable
- [ ] Give the text area the appearance of a sheet of paper


### Fixes & bugs

- [ ] I really do not want to make a list of this right now.


### In progress

- [x] Load from docx file into Edda structure (CMGSK)
- [x] Make the toolbar look right (spacing, separators, etc.)


### Done
